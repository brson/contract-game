## Our prototype game contract


## Implementing our contract

ink_storage::HashMap doesn't implement Clone.

We try to put an `ink_storage::HashMap` into a custom `GameAccount` struct
inside another `ink_storage::HashMap`, inside our `Game` storage type.

Something like

```rust
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Game {
        game_accounts: ink_storage::HashMap<AccountId, GameAccount>,
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Clone, scale::Encode, scale::Decode, ink_storage_derive::PackedLayout, ink_storage_derive::SpreadLayout)]
    pub struct GameAccount {
        level: u32,
        level_programs: ink_storage::HashMap<u32, AccountId>,
    }
```

It doesn't work, with a bunch of errors about traits like `WrapperTypeEncode`
not being implemented for types like `ink_storage::HashMap`.

We look at the ink examples and don't see any using nested collection
types in their storage type.
Instead they all use a "flat" data model.
I don't really want to do that because it will be harder to maintain
the invariants I want.
Reading the API docs for `scale::Encode` we see that the standard
`BTreeMap` type implements it,
so instead of nesting `ink_storage::HashMap`s inside each other,
we use a `BTreeMap` instead, like

```rust
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Game {
        game_accounts: ink_storage::HashMap<AccountId, GameAccount>,
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Clone, scale::Encode, scale::Decode, ink_storage_derive::PackedLayout, ink_storage_derive::SpreadLayout)]
    pub struct GameAccount {
        level: u32,
        level_programs: BTreeMap<u32, AccountId>,
    }
```

I imagine this will be inefficient,
but for now we want our code to be readable,
not efficient.


For each level of our game,
our game contract needs to call a player's "level contract".
So each of our levels defines a contract interface,
and each player implements that interface in their own
contract for the level.

When we start trying to figure out how to call another
arbitrary contract,
using only some interface,
we run into a lack of examples and documentation.




While incrementally adding features,
experimenting with ink APIs,
and attempting to debug,
we find that we don't know how to do "println debugging":
ink defines [`ink_env::debug_println`],
but when we use it we don't see any output anywhere.

[`ink_env::debug_println`]: https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_env/fn.debug_println.html

I aske in the `#ink:matrix.parity.io` channel where to see the output,
and Alexander TheiÃŸen replies:

> "They are printed to the console. You need to raise the log level for `runtime`
  module in order to see them. I also recommend to silence all the block
  production noise: `-lerror,runtime=debug`"

So those are presumably flags to `canvas-node`.


We have Alice construct our game contract,
and want to test having that contract
call another contract (a "level contract").
For testing purposes that level contract is the
"flipper" example contract.
We upload that contract and have Bob construct it.

We are confused about:

- Are contracts identified by users' account IDs,
  or do they have their own account IDs?
- How can we find the account ID of a contract we've constructed?

We're confused every step of the way.

While trying to figure out Bob's account ID we make two discoveries:

1) The `subkey inspect` command:

    ```
    subkey inspect //Bob
    Secret Key URI `//Bob` is account:
      Secret seed:      0x398f0c28f98885e046333d4a41c19cee4c37368a9832c6502f6cfd182e2aef89
      Public key (hex): 0x8eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693c912909cb226aa4794f26a48
      Account ID:       0x8eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693c912909cb226aa4794f26a48
      SS58 Address:     5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty
    ```

    I don't fully understand how to specify account names, but I know
    that `//Alice` and `//Bob` are known test accounts. This `subkey inspect`
    command gives the account id and secret key.

    The `subkey` command is part of the substrate repo and [the command
    for installing it is a bit awkward][subkeycommand], but easy enough
    to copy-paste.

2) The [polkadot explorer][pex] can be configured to connect to my
   local devnet!

   This seems pretty huge. I can see account ID's here, and hopefully
   even more useful info about what is going on inside my devnet.

[subkeycommand]: https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#build-from-source
[pex]: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer



Both canvas-ui and the polkadot.js explorer cache information about
code hashes (and probably other things) they've seen, but
which don't actually exist on the chain they are currently connected to.
This is maddening every time I restart my devnet and see a bunch of
hashes of old contracts that I can't distinguish from the new contracts.

These apps should either verify these code hashes actually exist on
chain, or at least give me a big red "reset" button to purge all
this incorrect info.

At some point I had canvas-ui showing me two "flipper" contracts,
and I didn't know which one was real,
so I told it to "forget" both of them.
Then I tried to redeploy flipper,
but of course flipper was already deployed so I got an error,
and now I don't know the correct address of flipper,
and can't add it back to the UI and I'm stuck,
have to shut down my devnet and restart it.

I now have a habit of going through all the canvas-ui tabs
and "forgetting" everything every time I restart canvas-node.

At least the polkadot explorer says "not on-chain" for code
hashes that don't actually exist.

Another note: there are many opportunities in both UIs to
"add a code hash", but it seems like this option is useless
unless you also provide the contract metadata.
TODO why this sucks

After some experimenting I learn that
constructing a contract creates a new account;
that is, a contract is not associated with the account
of the user that creates it; a contract has its own account.



We execute transactions in the canvas-ui, but no
events seem to register in the explorer ui.

We're going to have to add logging _everywhere_
to have any clue what the hell is going on.



## Connecting to our contract with polkadot-js

It's strange that the JS compononts are "polkadot"-branded,
where so many other things in this ecosystem are "substrate"-branded.

I try not to use npm unless I have to.
Trying to create a simple frontend using plain HTML and JavaScript.
All the documentation for the polkadot JS API assumes the use of node/yarn.
I am trying to figure out how to use webpack to package up @polkadot/api so I can use it outside npm,
but don't know how.

I have previously succeeded in this with web3.js and ipfs.js,
but don't really remember how,
and don't see any obvious evidence that the polkadot APIs are ready to webpack.

I ask in #ink:matrix.parity.io

> I'm not very familiar with npm programming, and I want to use the
  @polkadot/api from a non-npm script in the browser. Is it possible to use
  webpack to package @polkadot/api into a standalone javascript file that I can
  use outside of npm. Any hints how to do that?

In the meantime I give up trying to package polkadot-js for use
outside of npm,
and try to set up a yarn app that will let me import the the library
in the expected way.

As someone mostly unfamiliar with npm I immediately encounter more problems.
I know how to add `@polkadot/api` to a yarn project,
but I don't know how to set yarn up to run a server on `yarn start`.
From Googling, as with most things in the npm ecosystem,
there seem to be many options.

Similar to the Ethereum docs,
I'm finding that the polkadot-js docs completely gloss over topics
about setting up npm/parn projects,
and I am completely lost.

I know that I can't expect Polkadot to teach me npm,
just like I can't expect them to teach me Rust,
but this has been a huge problem for me every time I try to use modern JavaScript.

On https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/examples/promise/ it says

> "From each folder, run yarn to install the required dependencies and then run
  yarn start to execute the example against the running node."

But there are no "folders" in this documentation.
Is there a link to actual, complete, ready-to-run source code I'm missing?

I'm quite frustrated.

I additionally ask in the "#ink" channel if there's a basic
yarn template for using the polkadot JS API's.

Dan Shields comes through with a link to

> https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template

I recall seeing this before and must have forgotten about it.
I'll try to reboot my web efforts from this template.

Well, maybe I'll just use it for hints.
It's a react app, and I really don't want to learn react right now.
So complex.

I am going to try instead using `webpack-dev-server` for my `yarn start` command.

I eventually follow the [webpack "Getting Started" guide][wpgs].
I'm real rak shaving now.

[wpgs]: https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

While running weback with my script that imports "@polkadot/api" I run into this error:

```
ERROR in ./node_modules/scryptsy/lib/utils.js 1:15-32
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto' in '/home/ubuntu/contract-game/www2/node_modules/scryptsy/lib'

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
        - add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "crypto": require.resolve("crypto-browserify") }'
        - install 'crypto-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
        resolve.fallback: { "crypto": false }
 ```

To fix this it seems I have to add a `webpack.config.js` and configure it per the
[webpack "resolve" instructions][wri].
After creating `webpack.config.js` I can more-or-less copy-paste the suggestion
straight from the command line.
My new `webpack.config.js` looks like

```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'main.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    resolve: {
        fallback: {
            "crypto": require.resolve("crypto-browserify")
        }
    }
};
```

I also have to `yarn add crypto-browserify`.
Once I do I see more similar errors about polyfills,
and when I finally have webpack working I have
three polyfills in my `webpack.config.js`:

```js
        fallback: {
            "buffer": require.resolve("buffer"),
            "crypto": require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
            "stream": require.resolve("stream-browserify")
        }
```

[wri]: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/

Hours and hours go by...

I'm using webpack 5,
which doesn't do a bunch of node polyfills when it compiles
for the browser.
I think that's a big part of my pain.

After tons of Googling and hacking I finally manage
to load the polkadot JS API in my mostly vanilla JS
web page.

I have to do a lot of hacks.

At the end my `webpack.config.js` looks like

```js
const path = require("path");
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
    mode: "development",
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'js/bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    resolve: {
        fallback: {
            "buffer": require.resolve("buffer"),
            "crypto": require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
            "stream": require.resolve("stream-browserify")
        }
    },
    plugins: [
        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
            Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer'],
        }),
    ]
};
```

That `plugins` section is new and mysterious,
just copy pasted from [some commit to some other
software project][webhack].

[webhack]: https://github.com/duplotech/create-react-app/commit/d0be703d40cd4bc32cd91128ba407a138c608243#diff-8e25c4f6f592c1fcfc38f0d43d62cbd68399f44f494c1b60f0cf9ccd7344d697

I also have this lovely garbage in my HTML header
before loading my webpack bundle:

```html
  <script>
    let global = window;
    let process = {
      "versions": null
    };
  </script>
```

Yup.

Somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong. Please.
