### Creating a pet

Captain can create a pet, for fun or selling to others,
by programming with provided libraries once this captain
achieved a required level.
For example, the state level with 10 finished programming tasks.

Captain can create more pets as long as there is enough
token for deploying their programs.
They can sell their pets just as NFT trading.
