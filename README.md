# The Captain's Ascent

A game of smart contract programming.

Learn to program blockchain smart contracts
on the [Substrate (Polkadot) blockchain][sbc],
in [the Rust programming language][rst].

## What is it?

In The Captain's Ascent,
you navigate to the top of The Tower of Fate,
where on each floor you must program
The Captain to solve a new puzzle.

Along the way,
you will learn how to write smart contracts
for Substrate,
in Rust.

Each puzzle presents a programming challenge
that can only be solved by writing increasingly
sophisticated [Smart Contracts].

By reaching the top of the tower,
you will become a seasoned smart contract author,
and the Champion of the Tower of Fate.

Ascend the tower far enough and gain access
to _the arena_,
where you can pit your captain against
other players' in a programming tournament.

Along the way you will discover functional and cosmetic
upgrades to customize your captain,
and earn rewards based on your performance.
These upgrades and rewards are represented on-chain
as [tokens] and [NFTs],
with all the capabilities that entails,
including trading.

[tokens]: todo
[NFTs]: todo

Each player's captain becomes customized over the course of the game,
and is also a tradable NFT.

It's a super-blockchainy game
in which you learn to be a super-blockchainy programmer.


## Technical summary

The game is implemented as a smart contract,
called "the game driver",
that runs on the [canvas] substrate network.
